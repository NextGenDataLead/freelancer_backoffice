- [x] `TASK4_BACKUP_*.tsx` (multiple backup files created)

**Critical Technical Implementation Details**:

**JWT Integration Fix**:
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Correct Supabase client configuration with Clerk JWT
const supabaseClient = useMemo(() => {
  return createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey, {
    accessToken: async () => {
      if (!session) return null
      return await session.getToken({ template: 'supabase' })
    }
  })
}, [session])
```

**Clerk JWT Template Configuration**:
```json
{
  "aud": "authenticated",
  "exp": {{date.now_plus(duration=60*60) | to_epoch}},
  "iat": {{date.now | to_epoch}},
  "iss": "{{env.CLERK_DOMAIN}}",
  "nbf": {{date.now | to_epoch}},
  "role": "authenticated",
  "app_metadata": {
    "tenant_id": "{{user.public_metadata.tenant_id}}",
    "role": "{{user.public_metadata.role}}"
  }
}
```

**Essential RLS Policies**:
```sql
-- Allow users to create tenants (required for new users)
CREATE POLICY "tenant_self_insert" ON tenants
  FOR INSERT TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (id = get_current_tenant_id());

-- Profile access policies
CREATE POLICY "tenant_isolation" ON profiles
  FOR SELECT TO authenticated
  USING (tenant_id = get_current_tenant_id());
```

**Global User Sync Implementation**:
- `useUserSync()` hook placed in `DashboardContent` component (line 83) for global sync
- Users automatically sync to Supabase when accessing any dashboard page
- Multi-tenant architecture with automatic tenant and profile creation

**Implementation Steps**:
- [x] **Pre-Implementation Backup**: Documented current user-related components
- [x] Created profile page with comprehensive form validation (React Hook Form + Zod)
- [x] Implemented avatar upload with image preview and Clerk integration
- [x] Added user preferences section (theme, notifications, language settings)
- [x] **CRITICAL BREAKTHROUGH**: Fixed Clerk + Supabase JWT integration using accessToken callback method
- [x] Resolved RLS policy issues preventing tenant creation
- [x] Implemented global user synchronization in dashboard component
- [x] Created server-side API endpoints for metadata updates
- [x] Enhanced authentication state management with profile sync
- [x] **Post-Implementation Comprehensive E2E Test** (All tests passed):
   - ✅ Complete profile management (form validation, avatar upload, preferences)
   - ✅ Profile navigation and access from dashboard
   - ✅ Complete authentication flow (sign-up, sign-in, logout)
