- [x] `src/store/auth-store.ts` (enhanced auth state management)
- [x] `TASK4_BACKUP_*.tsx` (multiple backup files created)

**Critical Technical Implementation Details**:

**JWT Integration Fix**:
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Correct Supabase client configuration with Clerk JWT
const supabaseClient = useMemo(() => {
  return createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey, {
    accessToken: async () => {
      if (!session) return null
      return await session.getToken({ template: 'supabase' })
    }
  })
}, [session])
```

**Clerk JWT Template Configuration**:
```json
{
  "aud": "authenticated",
  "exp": {{date.now_plus(duration=60*60) | to_epoch}},
  "iat": {{date.now | to_epoch}},
  "iss": "{{env.CLERK_DOMAIN}}",
  "nbf": {{date.now | to_epoch}},
  "role": "authenticated",
  "app_metadata": {
    "tenant_id": "{{user.public_metadata.tenant_id}}",
    "role": "{{user.public_metadata.role}}"
  }
}
```

**Essential RLS Policies**:
```sql
-- Allow users to create tenants (required for new users)
CREATE POLICY "tenant_self_insert" ON tenants
  FOR INSERT TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (id = get_current_tenant_id());

-- Profile access policies
CREATE POLICY "tenant_isolation" ON profiles
  FOR SELECT TO authenticated
  USING (tenant_id = get_current_tenant_id());
```

**Global User Sync Implementation**:
- `useUserSync()` hook placed in `DashboardContent` component (line 83) for global sync
- Users automatically sync to Supabase when accessing any dashboard page
- Multi-tenant architecture with automatic tenant and profile creation

**Implementation Steps**:
- [x] **Pre-Implementation Backup**: Documented current user-related components
- [x] Created profile page with comprehensive form validation (React Hook Form + Zod)
- [x] Implemented avatar upload with image preview and Clerk integration
- [x] Added user preferences section (theme, notifications, language settings)
- [x] **CRITICAL BREAKTHROUGH**: Fixed Clerk + Supabase JWT integration using accessToken callback method
- [x] Resolved RLS policy issues preventing tenant creation
- [x] Implemented global user synchronization in dashboard component
- [x] Created server-side API endpoints for metadata updates
- [x] Enhanced authentication state management with profile sync
- [x] **Post-Implementation Comprehensive E2E Test** (All tests passed):
   - ✅ Complete profile management (form validation, avatar upload, preferences)
   - ✅ Profile navigation and access from dashboard
   - ✅ Complete authentication flow (sign-up, sign-in, logout)
   - ✅ Landing page functionality and all navigation preserved
   - ✅ Dashboard widgets and existing functionality working
   - ✅ Mobile profile management fully responsive
   - ✅ Form error handling and validation messages

   - ✅ User data automatically syncs to Supabase database
   - ✅ Multi-tenant architecture working with proper isolation
   - ✅ Navigation between all existing pages preserved

**Major Technical Lessons Learned**:
1. **JWT Token Transmission**: Custom headers approach FAILED - only `accessToken` callback works with Clerk + Supabase
2. **RLS Policy Completeness**: Missing INSERT policies prevented tenant creation
3. **Global User Sync**: Placing `useUserSync()` in dashboard component ensures immediate sync on dashboard access
4. **Metadata Updates**: Server-side API endpoints required for reliable metadata updates
5. **Database Integration**: Proper JWT template structure critical for RLS function compatibility

**Database Records Verified**: User profile (ID: a5504c9f-92a0-4cc9-84f5-a865291e22ed) and tenant (ID: b5aeed2b-be4e-47ca-8fac-c6756452eee1) successfully created in Supabase

#### Task 5: Account Settings & Security ✅ COMPLETED

**Features Implemented**:
- **Multiple Chart Types**: Line charts (User Growth), Bar charts (Revenue vs Target), Pie charts (Traffic Sources), Donut charts (Device Types)
- **Key Metrics Overview**: 4 metric cards with trend indicators, icons, and color coding
- **Comprehensive Filtering**: Date range picker (7 predefined ranges), Traffic Source, Device Type, Location dropdowns
- **Filter State Management**: Active filter display, reset functionality, filter indicators
- **Professional UI**: Responsive layout, collapsible filter sidebar, export/refresh buttons ready for integration
- **Additional Insights**: Top performing pages, recent activity feed, quick stats section

**⚠️ Important Limitations**:
1. **Data Filtering Not Connected**: The filtering UI is fully functional but does NOT actually filter the chart data. Charts display the same static sample data regardless of selected filters.
2. **Expected Production Behavior**: In real implementation, changing filters should:
   - Trigger API calls to fetch filtered data based on selected date range and filters
   - Update all charts to reflect the filtered dataset
   - Recalculate metrics based on the filtered timeframe
3. **Filter State Persistence**: Filter state resets when navigating away and back to analytics page (not persisted)

**Next Steps for Production**:
- Connect filter state to backend API calls for real data fetching
- Implement loading states and error handling for data operations
- Add filter state persistence via URL parameters or session storage
- Integrate with real analytics data sources and APIs

**Technical Architecture**:
- All chart components are fully reusable with configurable props
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Consistent styling using Tailwind CSS and professional color schemes
- Ready for integration with global state management if needed
- Accessible design with proper ARIA labels and responsive behavior

- TypeScript interfaces for dashboard metrics with tenant isolation support
- Fallback data system ensuring UI never breaks regardless of database state

**Database Schema Ready**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE dashboard_metrics (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  tenant_id UUID REFERENCES tenants(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  metric_key TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'revenue', 'users', 'conversion', 'session'
  value TEXT NOT NULL,
  change_value TEXT,
  change_type TEXT CHECK (change_type IN ('positive', 'negative', 'neutral')),
  trend_data JSONB DEFAULT '[]',
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(tenant_id, metric_key)
);

3. **Dependency Check**: Verify all required packages are installed
4. **Environment Setup**: Ensure development environment is ready

### During Implementation:
1. **Incremental Development**: Make small, testable changes
2. **Type Safety**: Maintain strict TypeScript compliance
3. **Component Isolation**: Test components in isolation when possible
4. **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines
5. **Performance**: Consider bundle size and performance impact

### After Each Task:

CREATE TABLE notifications (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  tenant_id UUID REFERENCES tenants(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  type TEXT CHECK (type IN ('info', 'success', 'warning', 'error')),
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  message TEXT NOT NULL,
