## Task 13 Implementation Plan
Based on the backup assessment, Task 13 needs to create comprehensive privacy controls from scratch while integrating with existing Clerk authentication and cookie consent systems.

### Priority Implementation Order:
1. Privacy controls page with navigation
2. Data export functionality (user profile, preferences, activity logs)
3. Account deletion with 30-day grace period
4. Email notifications for privacy actions
5. Audit trail for privacy-related activities

This backup confirms Task 13 is starting from a clean state with good foundations from existing authentication and cookie consent systems.
