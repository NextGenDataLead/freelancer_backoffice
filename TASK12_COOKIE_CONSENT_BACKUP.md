### Missing Implementation

- ❌ No analytics integration with consent

### Assessment
The existing cookie consent component is well-implemented and GDPR-compliant, but it's not being used in the application. Task 12 needs to:
1. Integrate the component into the root layout
2. Create supporting utilities and hooks
3. Add analytics integration with consent checking
4. Ensure proper GDPR compliance throughout the app

## Plan for Task 12 Completion
1. Add CookieConsent component to root layout
2. Create cookie manager utility with consent checking functions
3. Create useCookieConsent hook for easy integration
4. Add analytics integration that respects consent preferences
5. Test complete GDPR compliance flow
