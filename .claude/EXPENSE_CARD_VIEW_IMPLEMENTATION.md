## Technical Architecture

### Data Structures

```typescript
interface MonthGroup {
  monthKey: string          // "2025-01" format for sorting
  monthDisplay: string      // "January 2025" for display
  expenses: ExpenseWithSupplier[]
  total: number            // Total spending for month
  count: number            // Number of expenses
  categoryBreakdown: CategorySummary[]
}

interface CategorySummary {
  categoryKey: string      // DB category key
  categoryDisplay: string  // Human-readable name
  total: number           // Total for this category
  count: number           // Number of expenses
  color: string           // Color for visual indicator
}
```

### Data Flow

1. **Fetch**: Load 100 most recent expenses from API
2. **Group**: Use Map to group by month (YYYY-MM format)
3. **Aggregate**: Calculate totals and category breakdowns per month
4. **Sort**:
   - Months: Newest first
   - Categories within month: Highest total first
   - Expenses within month: Newest first
5. **Render**: Generate card-based UI with conditional expansion

### Category Colors
Six colors cycle through categories:
- Orange: `rgba(251, 146, 60, 0.7)`
- Blue: `rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.7)`
- Purple: `rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.7)`
- Cyan: `rgba(34, 211, 238, 0.7)`
- Pink: `rgba(236, 72, 153, 0.7)`
- Green: `rgba(34, 197, 94, 0.7)`

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Potential Improvements

1. **Pagination/Infinite Scroll**
   - Currently loads 100 expenses
   - Could add "Load More" button for older months
   - Or implement infinite scroll

2. **Search and Filters**
   - Add search bar to filter expenses by description/vendor
   - Filter by category (dropdown or chips)
   - Date range picker for custom periods
   - Amount range filter

3. **Bulk Actions**
   - Checkbox selection for multiple expenses
   - Bulk approve/delete
   - Bulk category reassignment
   - Export selected to CSV

4. **Enhanced Category Breakdown**
   - Click category chip to filter expenses in current month
   - Show category trend (up/down from previous month)
   - Expandable "Show all categories" for months with 7+ categories

5. **Visual Enhancements**
   - Add small sparkline chart showing daily spending trend in month header
   - Receipt thumbnails for expenses with attachments
   - Currency exchange rate indicator for foreign expenses
   - Tax deduction indicator (green badge for fully deductible)

6. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Virtual scrolling for months (if loading many)
   - Lazy load expense details when month expands
   - Memoize category color assignments

7. **Mobile Responsiveness**
   - Adjust card layout for mobile screens
   - Stack expense row elements vertically on small screens
   - Simplify category breakdown grid (1-2 columns)

8. **Accessibility**
   - Add ARIA labels for screen readers
   - Keyboard navigation for expand/collapse
   - Focus management when opening/closing months

## User Research Insights

Based on Exa MCP research, modern expense tracking UIs favor:
- **Card-based layouts** (Pinterest, Dribbble, Syncfusion examples)
- **Minimalism** (Zero UI design trend)
- **Timeline views** with chronological ordering
- **Category visualization** via colored badges/chips
- **Quick actions** (edit/delete) directly on expense rows
- **Summary metrics** always visible

This implementation aligns with these best practices.

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Expenses load correctly
- [x] Months grouped properly
- [x] Current month expands by default
- [x] Toggle expand/collapse works
- [x] Category breakdown calculates correctly
- [x] Expenses sorted by date within month
- [x] Edit button opens expense form
- [x] Delete button removes expense
- [x] Empty state shows when no expenses
- [x] Loading state displays spinner
- [x] Error state shows error message
- [x] Category colors cycle correctly
- [x] VAT amount displays when present
- [x] Status badges show correct state
- [x] Hover effects work on expense rows
- [x] Event listeners refresh data on create/delete

## Known Issues / Limitations

1. **Fixed 100 expense limit**: Only loads most recent 100 expenses. May miss older expenses if user has many.
2. **No persistence**: Expanded/collapsed state resets on page refresh
3. **No URL state**: Can't share link to specific month or expense
4. **Limited mobile testing**: Design optimized for desktop, may need adjustments for mobile
5. **No loading skeleton**: Uses simple spinner, could add skeleton cards for better UX

## Developer Notes

### Key Functions

- `groupedExpenses` (useMemo): Main data transformation logic
- `toggleMonth`: Handles expand/collapse state
- `handleDelete`: Delete expense with confirmation
- `getCategoryDisplayName`: Maps DB keys to readable names
- `getCategoryColor`: Assigns colors to categories

### Event System

Listens for custom window events:
- `expense:created` → Refetch expenses
- `expense:deleted` → Refetch expenses

These events are dispatched from ExpenseForm component.

### Styling Approach

Uses inline styles for dynamic values (colors, backgrounds) and Tailwind classes for static styles. This hybrid approach allows for:
- Dynamic glassmorphic effects
- Conditional styling based on state
- Consistent utility classes where appropriate

## Conclusion

The card-based timeline view successfully addresses the "cluttered" feedback by:
- Reducing visual noise through progressive disclosure
- Grouping related information logically (by month)
- Providing clear visual hierarchy
- Making key information scannable at a glance
- Maintaining all functionality (edit, delete, status)

The implementation is complete and production-ready.
