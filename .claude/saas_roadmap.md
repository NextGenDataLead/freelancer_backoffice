# SaaS Product Roadmap: The All-in-One Dutch ZZP'er Financial Suite

## Core Philosophy: Your Business, Simplified

The fundamental goal of this SaaS is to empower the Dutch ZZP'er by building a platform centered on three core principles:

*   **Minimize Effort:** Drastically reduce the time and mental energy spent on financial administration through intelligent automation, from data entry to tax filing. Every feature must be designed to be intuitive and time-saving.
*   **Minimize Cost:** Provide a superior, all-in-one solution that eliminates the need for a separate, expensive accountant for the vast majority of ZZP use cases, delivering exceptional value for money.
*   **Maximize Insight:** Go beyond simple bookkeeping. Offer proactive, personalized financial and fiscal insights that help the user make smarter business decisions, optimize their tax situation, and forecast their financial future with confidence.

*   **1. Bank Integration & Reconciliation:**

        *   Provide a clear "Tax Savings Goal" to help users set aside the correct amount of money.

*   **4. Secure Third-Party Access:**
    *   Create a secure, read-only portal for authorized external parties.
    *   The ZZP'er can grant temporary, revocable access to specific data sets (e.g., "Full P&L and Balance Sheet for Notary" or "All invoices and expenses for the last 2 years for a mortgage advisor").
    *   Access is logged and auditable.
