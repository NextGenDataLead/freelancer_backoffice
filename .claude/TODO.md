- Print for invoice should not print the html page but the pdf
- BE is noted on the invoice as "Export buiten EU: Deze factuur betreft een export buiten de EU en is daarom vrijgesteld van BTW.". This is not the case, the country is within the EU and therefore reverse charge applies. Make sure you fetch and store all fiscal rules into a supabase database, both raw including sources as well as the LLM optimized versions
- Make sure to adhere to all specifications of a Dutch invoice to ensure compliancy
