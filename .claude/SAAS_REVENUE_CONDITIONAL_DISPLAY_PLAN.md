# SaaS Revenue Stream Conditional Display Plan

## Overview
Transform the dashboard to properly support both time-based-only freelancers and hybrid SaaS+time-based business models by making SaaS revenue components truly optional and conditional.

## Key Requirements Analysis
- **Time-based work**: Always enabled by default (no toggle needed)
- **SaaS revenue**: Optional feature that can be enabled/disabled
- **Conditional UI**: Hide MAU and subscription fee metrics when SaaS is disabled
- **Health score**: Adapt scoring, explanations, and recommendations based on business model
- **Zero breaking changes**: Maintain all existing functionality

## Phase 1: Settings Enhancement
### Business Settings Page (`/dashboard/settings/business`)
1. **Update Profit Targets Form**:
   - Remove toggle for time-based revenue (always enabled)
   - Keep toggle for subscription revenue (optional)
   - Set time-based as default with reasonable defaults (160h, €75/h)
   - Add clear explanations for business model choice

2. **Form Logic Updates**:
   - Time-based fields always visible and required
   - Subscription fields only visible when enabled
   - Validation ensures at least time-based is configured
   - Better UX copy explaining the business model implications

## Phase 2: Dashboard Metrics Conditional Display
### Metrics Cards Component
1. **MAU Card (Card 4)**: Hide completely when subscription disabled
2. **Average Subscription Fee Card (Card 5)**: Hide completely when subscription disabled
3. **Grid Layout**: Adjust from 5-column to 3-column grid when SaaS disabled
4. **Time-based Cards**: Always visible (Revenue, Hours, Avg Rate)

### Detection Logic
```typescript
const subscriptionEnabled = profitTargets?.target_monthly_active_users > 0 &&
                           profitTargets?.target_avg_subscription_fee > 0
const gridColumns = subscriptionEnabled ? 'xl:grid-cols-5' : 'xl:grid-cols-3'
```

## Phase 3: Health Score Engine Updates
### Health Score Calculations
1. **Profit Score Calculator**: Already has conditional logic - enhance messaging
2. **Risk Score Calculator**: Remove subscription-based penalties when disabled
3. **Explanations**: Hide subscription-related metrics and explanations
4. **Recommendations**: Filter out subscription-focused recommendations

### Business Health Report
1. **Metrics Display**: Hide subscription metrics sections
2. **Scoring Explanations**: Adapt text to focus on time-based business
3. **Recommendations**: Only show relevant recommendations
4. **Top 3 Combined**: Automatically excludes subscription recommendations

## Phase 4: API & Data Layer
### Profit Targets API
- Maintain existing structure (no breaking changes)
- Ensure 0 values for disabled streams work correctly
- Update validation to require at least time-based configuration

### Time Stats API
- Keep subscription data structure for backward compatibility
- Return empty/zero subscription data when not applicable
- Maintain consistent API response format

## Phase 5: UX Improvements
### Settings Page Experience
1. **Business Model Selection**: Clear visual distinction between models
2. **Setup Flow**: Guide users through choosing their business model
3. **Explanatory Text**: Help users understand when to enable SaaS revenue
4. **Validation Messages**: Clear feedback on configuration requirements

### Dashboard Experience
1. **Clean Layout**: Responsive grid that adapts to business model
2. **Focused Metrics**: Only show relevant KPIs
3. **Health Score**: Accurate scoring for business model
4. **Recommendations**: Actionable advice for their specific setup

## Implementation Safety
### Zero Breaking Changes
- All existing APIs remain unchanged
- Database schema remains identical
- Existing configurations continue working
- Gradual rollout possible per user

### Backward Compatibility
- Users with subscription already enabled: no changes
- Users with time-based only: improved experience
- New users: guided setup for their business model
- Health score: accurate for both models

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for conditional logic
- Integration tests for health score variations
- E2E tests for both business model flows
- Performance impact assessment

## Success Criteria
1. ✅ Time-based freelancers see only relevant metrics
2. ✅ SaaS+Time hybrid users see full dashboard
3. ✅ Health scores accurate for business model
4. ✅ Settings clearly guide business model choice
5. ✅ Zero existing functionality broken
6. ✅ Responsive design works for both layouts

- Add graceful degradation for missing subscription data
- Ensure responsive design works for 3-column and 5-column layouts
- Consider accessibility implications of conditional rendering
