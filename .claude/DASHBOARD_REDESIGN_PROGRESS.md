## 🤝 Handoff Instructions

### To Continue Development:

1. **Read this document completely** to understand context
2. **Start with Task 1** (Replace Monthly Progress Cards)
3. **Test after each task** before moving to next
4. **Update this document** with any new decisions
5. **Mark tasks as completed** as you finish them

### If You Get Stuck:

- Check existing components (ActiveTimerWidget, ClientHealthDashboard) for patterns
- Review `/api/time-entries/stats` response structure for data access
- Look at `CompactMetricCard` props for customization options
- The `formatCurrency()` helper is defined in the main file

### Questions to Ask Product Owner:

- Should ClientHealthDashboard be replaced or kept?
- Tax tracking: What's the actual calculation formula?
- Widget priority: Which 3-4 widgets are most important?
- Mobile: Should some sections be hidden on small screens?
