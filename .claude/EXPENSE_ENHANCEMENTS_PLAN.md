# Expense Card View - Enhancements Implementation Plan

## Current State Analysis

### ‚úÖ Already Implemented
- Card-based monthly layout with glassmorphic design
- Category breakdown summary (top 6 categories per month)
- Chronological expense sorting
- Expand/collapse months (current month expanded by default)
- Edit and Delete actions
- Event-driven data refresh

### ‚ùå Known Limitations
1. **Fixed 100 expense limit** - Only fetches most recent 100 expenses
2. **No persistence** - Expanded/collapsed state resets on refresh
3. **No URL state** - Can't share links to specific months
4. **Simple loading** - Uses spinner instead of skeleton
5. **No search/filters** - Can't filter by description, vendor, category, date
6. **No bulk actions** - Can't select/delete/approve multiple expenses
7. **Limited mobile** - Design optimized for desktop only
8. **No accessibility** - Missing ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

## Technical Decisions

### Libraries to Add
- `recharts` or `victory-native` for sparkline charts
- `react-intersection-observer` for infinite scroll
- `react-day-picker` for date range picker (already in project?)

### Performance Optimizations
- Memoize expense grouping logic (already done)
- Virtualize long expense lists if needed
- Debounce search input (300ms)
- Lazy load receipt images

### State Management
- Keep using React local state for UI
- Use URL params for shareable filters
- Use localStorage for user preferences
- Consider Zustand store if state becomes complex

## Rollout Strategy

1. **Week 1**: Phases 1-3 (Pagination, Filters, Bulk Actions)
2. **Week 2**: Phases 4-6 (Enhanced Categories, Visuals, State)
3. **Week 3**: Phases 7-8 (Mobile, Accessibility)
4. **Week 4**: Phase 9 (Testing, Documentation)

## Success Metrics

- [ ] All expenses loadable (not just 100)
- [ ] Search finds relevant expenses < 1 second
- [ ] Filters can be combined (e.g., category + date range)
- [ ] Bulk delete works for 50+ expenses
- [ ] Mobile layout works on iPhone SE (375px width)
- [ ] Passes accessibility audit (Lighthouse)
- [ ] 80%+ test coverage on new code
- [ ] No performance regression (< 3s initial load)

## Risk Mitigation

### Performance Risks
- **Risk**: Large expense lists slow down rendering
- **Mitigation**: Virtual scrolling, lazy loading images

### Data Risks
- **Risk**: Bulk delete accidentally removes important expenses
- **Mitigation**: Confirmation modal with expense count + preview

### UX Risks
- **Risk**: Too many filters overwhelm users
- **Mitigation**: Collapsible filter bar, smart defaults

## Open Questions

1. Should we support saved filter presets?
2. Should we add expense templates for recurring expenses?
3. Should we integrate with OCR for receipt scanning?
4. Should we add expense approval workflow?
