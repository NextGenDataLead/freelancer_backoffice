## Competitive Analysis: Tellow

### In-depth Analysis of Tellow and Comparison with Moneybird, e-Boekhouden.nl, and Jortt

#### Introduction
This report provides a comprehensive analysis of Tellow, a Dutch financial software provider, focusing on its features, pricing, user experience (UX), and its specific suitability for ZZP'ers (freelance IT consultants) in the Netherlands. It also compares Tellow against three other prominent Dutch financial software solutions: Moneybird, e-Boekhouden.nl, and Jortt.

#### Tellow Overview

##### Features
Tellow offers a range of features tailored to freelancers and small businesses, including:
- Invoice creation and sending with professional templates and the ability to use your own logo and corporate identity.
- Unlimited invoice sending and receipt scanning via mobile apps (iOS & Android).
- Hours and mileage tracking with detailed reporting.
- Automatic VAT return calculation and preparation.
- Real-time financial overview with bank transaction loading and linking.
- Automatic payment reminders and payment requests.
- Personal bookkeeping support and advice, including a personal bookkeeper option in higher tiers.
- Integration with the Dutch tax authorities (Belastingdienst) for direct submission of VAT and income tax returns.
- Multiple user profiles and secure data storage with encryption and SSO authentication.

##### Pricing
Tellow offers four pricing tiers:
- **Free Forever:** €0/month, includes basic invoicing (up to 3 invoices/month), receipt scanning, hours and mileage tracking, VAT calculation, and mobile apps.
- **Basis:** €12.99/month (excl. VAT), includes unlimited invoices, receipts, bank loading, payment reminders, and free switching service.
- **Plus:** €22.99/month (excl. VAT), adds automatic VAT filing, personal advisor support, linking up to five bank accounts, unlimited users, and quotation management.
- **Compleet:** €69.99/month (excl. VAT), includes a personal bookkeeper, full business and personal tax handling, direct phone support, and comprehensive tax return checks. This tier is specifically available for sole traders (ZZP) ([Tellow Pricing](https://www.tellow.nl/en/prijs)).

##### User Experience and Suitability for ZZP'er IT Consultants
Tellow is highly rated for its user-friendly interface and professional, prompt customer support. Reviews highlight its suitability for freelancers, including IT consultants, due to its automation of bookkeeping tasks, smart reminders for tax deadlines, and availability of English language support, which is beneficial for expats. The mobile app is praised for ease of use, and the integration with tax authorities simplifies compliance. The personal bookkeeper option in the Compleet plan offers additional security and expert advice, which is valuable for ZZP'ers managing their finances independently ([Trustpilot Tellow Reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tellow.nl)).

#### Comparison with Competitors

##### Moneybird
Moneybird is designed for small businesses and freelancers, offering features such as invoicing, bookkeeping, expense tracking, and report generation. It is known for its ease of use and smooth interface, making it popular among freelancers. Pricing details are less explicitly available in the crawled data, but Moneybird is generally positioned as a mid-range solution. It has a strong reputation for automation and integration capabilities. User reviews rate Moneybird slightly higher than Tellow on Trustpilot, with a 4.3/5 rating ([Moneybird Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.moneybird.nl)).

##### e-Boekhouden.nl
This platform is suitable for entrepreneurs, associations, and accountants. It offers online bookkeeping, invoicing, and hour registration. e-Boekhouden.nl is free for starters for the first 15 months, which is attractive for new ZZP'ers. It is recognized for its simplicity and expert helpdesk support. However, it lacks full English language support, which can be a barrier for non-Dutch speakers. User reviews are mixed, with a 4.3/5 rating on Trustpilot but some complaints about usability and customer service responsiveness ([e-Boekhouden.nl Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.e-boekhouden.nl)).

##### Jortt
Jortt offers automatic accounting, VAT return filing, and financial statements, targeting entrepreneurs and associations. It emphasizes a unique bookkeeping method aimed at efficiency. However, user reviews are notably less favorable, with a 2.6/5 Trustpilot rating, citing issues with software quality and customer service. Pricing information suggests it is positioned similarly to Tellow's higher tiers but with less positive feedback on user experience ([Jortt Trustpilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/jortt.nl)).

#### Summary and Recommendations
Tellow stands out for its comprehensive feature set tailored to ZZP'ers, including IT consultants, with strong automation, mobile support, and personal bookkeeping services. Its pricing is competitive, especially with the free and Basis plans for startups and small businesses. The Compleet plan offers a high level of service with a personal bookkeeper, which is a significant advantage for freelancers seeking expert support.

Moneybird is a strong alternative with a slightly better reputation for UX and automation but may come at a higher price point. e-Boekhouden.nl is attractive for new entrepreneurs due to its free starter offer but may pose challenges for non-Dutch speakers. Jortt, while offering similar features, suffers from lower user satisfaction and is less recommended based on current reviews.

For ZZP'er IT consultants in the Netherlands, Tellow offers a balanced combination of usability, features, and support, making it a highly suitable choice, particularly for those who value personal bookkeeping assistance and seamless tax integration.

## Technical Deep Dive: Digipoort API

### Technical Overview of the Digipoort API for Accounting SaaS Development

#### Introduction
Digipoort is the secure, government-operated gateway for SBR (Standard Business Reporting) in the Netherlands. Integration is mandatory for submitting tax declarations like VAT (`Omzetbelasting`) and Income Tax (`Inkomstenbelasting`) from software.

#### 1. Architecture and Standards
- **Protocols:** Digipoort primarily uses older, enterprise-grade standards. It does **not** use modern REST APIs for SBR.
    - **WUS 2.0 (SOAP / WS-*):** The main standard for synchronous SBR filings.
    - **ebMS2:** An asynchronous, reliable SOAP-based protocol.
    - **FTP:** For very large batch files.
- **Data Format:** All financial reports must be submitted in **XBRL** (eXtensible Business Reporting Language) format, conforming to the official Dutch SBR taxonomy.

#### 2. Authentication and Security
- **PKIoverheid Certificates:** This is the cornerstone of Digipoort security and a major technical hurdle.
    - **Mandatory:** All communication requires a specific, high-assurance PKIoverheid services server certificate.
    - **Complex Acquisition:** The application process is lengthy, involves strict face-to-face identity verification, and can take several weeks.
    - **Lifecycle Management:** Certificates have a finite lifespan and must be renewed in a timely manner to avoid service disruption.

#### 3. Process for a New SaaS Vendor
1.  **Registration:** Formally register with Logius (the operator of Digipoort) via the Aansluit Suite portal.
2.  **Certificate Acquisition:** Apply for and receive a PKIoverheid certificate.
3.  **Development:**
    - Build a robust client capable of communicating via SOAP/WUS 2.0.
    - Develop an engine to generate compliant XBRL files based on the Dutch tax taxonomies.
4.  **Testing & Certification:** The software must pass a mandatory and rigorous testing and validation process in the Digipoort pre-production environment before being granted access to the live system.

#### 4. Key Hurdles
- **High Complexity:** The use of SOAP, WSDL, and XBRL presents a steep learning curve compared to modern REST/JSON APIs.
- **Significant Upfront Investment:** The time and cost to acquire the certificate, develop the integration, and complete the certification process are substantial.
- **Ongoing Maintenance:** Taxonomies and protocols are updated, requiring ongoing maintenance to remain compliant.

## Technical Deep Dive: PSD2 API Aggregators

### Technical and Strategic Overview of PSD2 API Aggregation Providers for the Dutch Market

#### Introduction
PSD2 (Revised Payment Services Directive) mandates that banks provide access to customer account data via APIs. API aggregators simplify this by providing a single, unified API to connect to multiple banks.

#### 1. Leading Providers & Dutch Bank Coverage
- **Tink:** Excellent coverage of major Dutch banks (ING, ABN AMRO, Rabobank, etc.).
- **Plaid:** Strong coverage of the top 3 Dutch banks, covering ~90% of consumer accounts.
- **Yapily:** Good coverage of over 14 Dutch banks and financial institutions.
- **Klarna (Kosma):** Provides access to major Dutch banks.

#### 2. API Quality and Developer Experience
- **Modern & Developer-Friendly:** Unlike Digipoort, these providers offer modern **RESTful APIs** with excellent documentation, SDKs (in multiple languages), and sandbox environments.
- **Pre-built UI Components:** Most providers (like Tink and Plaid) offer "Link" SDKs, which are pre-built front-end components that handle the entire user authentication and consent flow (SCA - Strong Customer Authentication), significantly reducing development effort.

#### 3. Key Features
- **Account Information Services (AIS):** The core feature, allowing the SaaS to retrieve account details, balances, and transaction histories.
- **Data Enrichment:** This is a key value-add. Providers like Tink and Plaid use AI to automatically clean up and categorize raw transaction data, identifying merchants and assigning expense categories. This can be a massive accelerator for building smart features.
- **Payment Initiation Services (PIS):** Allows initiating payments on behalf of the user (not a primary focus for our MVP, but a future possibility).

#### 4. Regulatory & Pricing Models
- **Simplified Regulation:** By using a licensed aggregator (AISP - Account Information Service Provider), the SaaS can often "piggyback" on their license, avoiding the need to get its own license from the Dutch Central Bank (DNB), which is a major advantage.
- **Usage-Based Pricing:** Pricing is typically based on consumption, such as a fee per connected user per month or per API call. This is a direct operational cost that must be factored into the SaaS's own pricing model.

#### 5. Conclusion for our SaaS
- **"Buy, Don't Build":** Using an aggregator is the only viable strategy.
- **Feasibility:** Integrating bank data is technically straightforward and much less complex than the Digipoort integration.
- **Strategic Choice:** The choice of provider will depend on a balance of bank coverage, data enrichment quality, and pricing. Tink and Plaid appear to be very strong contenders for the Dutch market.

## Fiscal Rulebook for Dutch ZZP'ers

### Fiscal Rulebook for Dutch ZZP'ers (Freelancers) 2024/2025

This comprehensive fiscal guide covers the essential tax rules, thresholds, and key deductions relevant to Dutch ZZP'ers (self-employed freelancers) for the years 2024 and 2025. It includes detailed explanations of the Urencriterium, Zelfstandigenaftrek, Startersaftrek, MKB-winstvrijstelling, and the Kleineondernemersregeling (KOR).

---

#### 1. Urencriterium (Hours Criterion)

The Urencriterium is a fundamental tax requirement for Dutch freelancers to qualify for various tax benefits. To meet this criterion, you must spend at least 1,225 hours per calendar year working on your business. This includes both direct work for clients and indirect activities such as bookkeeping, marketing, and administration. Even hours spent preparing to start your business count towards this total.

Practically, this equates to about 24 hours per week or 3 full days of 8 hours each dedicated to your business. The hours must be plausible relative to your turnover; very low turnover with many hours may raise scrutiny by the Tax Administration. 

If you have been on maternity leave, you can count the hours of leave (up to 16 weeks) based on your average working hours. For entrepreneurs receiving disability benefits (Wajong, WIA, WAO, or Ziektewet), a reduced threshold of 800 hours applies.

The Urencriterium applies to sole proprietors, general partnerships (vof), and professional partnerships (maatschap), where each partner must meet the 1,225 hours individually. It does not apply to private limited companies (bv) for certain allowances.

If you do not meet the Urencriterium, you lose eligibility for some tax benefits like the Zelfstandigenaftrek and Startersaftrek but still qualify for the MKB-winstvrijstelling (SME profit exemption).

You can track your hours in any way you prefer (Excel, app, accounting software). The Tax Administration may conduct spot checks and request evidence such as emails, agendas, or bank statements.

([KVK](https://www.kvk.nl/en/starting/the-dutch-hours-criterion-for-self-employed-professionals), [Belastingdienst](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontentnl/belastingdienst/zakelijk/winst/inkomstenbelasting/inkomstenbelasting_voor_ondernemers/voorwaarden_urencriterium))

---

#### 2. Zelfstandigenaftrek (Self-Employed Deduction)

The Zelfstandigenaftrek is a key tax deduction for ZZP'ers who meet the Urencriterium and are below the AOW (state pension) age at the start of the calendar year. It reduces taxable profit, thus lowering income tax.

- **2024:** The Zelfstandigenaftrek amount is €3,750.
- **2025:** The deduction decreases to €2,470 as part of a phased reduction.

The tax benefit is calculated at a rate of 37.48% of the deduction amount in 2025, effectively limiting the maximum tax advantage.

If your profit is too low to fully use the Zelfstandigenaftrek in a year, you can carry forward the unused portion for up to 9 years, provided your future profits are sufficient.

For entrepreneurs who have reached the AOW age at the start of the year, the Zelfstandigenaftrek is halved.

([Belastingdienst](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontentnl/belastingdienst/zakelijk/winst/inkomstenbelasting/veranderingen-inkomstenbelasting-2025/ondernemersaftrek-2025/zelfstandigenaftrek-2025), [Rabobank](https://www.rabobank.nl/bedrijven/eigen-bedrijf-starten/belasting/zelfstandigenaftrek-en-startersaftrek-zo-zit-dat))

---

#### 3. Startersaftrek (Start-Up Deduction)

The Startersaftrek is an additional deduction on top of the Zelfstandigenaftrek aimed at new entrepreneurs. To qualify, you must have been a freelancer for less than 5 years and not have applied the Zelfstandigenaftrek more than twice in the previous 5 years.

- In 2024 and 2025, the Startersaftrek adds €2,123 to the Zelfstandigenaftrek, increasing the total deductible amount.

This deduction is fully available even if your profit is less than the deduction amount.

([Rabobank](https://www.rabobank.nl/bedrijven/eigen-bedrijf-starten/belasting/zelfstandigenaftrek-en-startersaftrek-zo-zit-dat), [MKB Servicedesk](https://www.mkbservicedesk.nl/belastingen/aftrekposten/startersaftrek))

---

#### 4. MKB-winstvrijstelling (SME Profit Exemption)

The MKB-winstvrijstelling allows entrepreneurs to exempt a percentage of their profit from income tax after applying the entrepreneurs' deductions like Zelfstandigenaftrek.

- **2024:** The exemption rate is 13.31% of the profit after deductions.
- **2025:** The rate decreases slightly to 12.7%.

This exemption is automatically applied when filing income tax returns and provides a significant tax advantage by reducing taxable income.

The effective tax benefit of the MKB-winstvrijstelling is calculated at a tax rate of 37.48% in 2025.

([Belastingdienst](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontentnl/belastingdienst/zakelijk/winst/inkomstenbelasting/veranderingen-inkomstenbelasting-2025/mkb-winstvrijstelling-2025), [Rabobank](https://www.rabobank.nl/bedrijven/eigen-bedrijf-starten/belasting/mkb-winstvrijstelling-voor-startende-ondernemers-zo-zit-dat))

---

#### 5. Kleineondernemersregeling (KOR) - Small Businesses Scheme

The KOR is a VAT exemption scheme for small businesses including ZZP'ers with an annual turnover not exceeding €20,000.

If you opt into the KOR:

- You do not charge VAT on your invoices.
- You cannot deduct VAT on your business purchases and investments.
- You have fewer VAT administrative obligations.

Participation is voluntary unless your turnover is below €2,200 and you are not registered with the Chamber of Commerce, in which case you are automatically included.

To apply, you must submit a digital form through the Dutch Tax Administration's portal at least 4 weeks before the next VAT return period.

If your turnover exceeds €20,000, you must cancel participation and start charging VAT.

The scheme also includes provisions for businesses operating across EU countries (EU-KOR) with specific turnover thresholds and conditions.

([Business.gov.nl](https://business.gov.nl/subsidy/small-businesses-scheme), [Belastingdienst](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/en/business/business))

## Summary

For Dutch ZZP'ers in 2024 and 2025, the fiscal landscape involves careful attention to the Urencriterium to qualify for key deductions like Zelfstandigenaftrek and Startersaftrek, which are being gradually reduced in 2025. The MKB-winstvrijstelling continues to provide a valuable profit exemption, while the KOR offers VAT relief for small businesses with limited turnover. Meeting all criteria and understanding thresholds is crucial to maximizing tax benefits and compliance.

This rulebook synthesizes the most current authoritative information to empower freelancers to manage their fiscal responsibilities confidently and efficiently.
