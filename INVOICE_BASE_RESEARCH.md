# Best-in-Class Invoice Design Research & Enhancement Plan

## Research Summary

Based on comprehensive research into modern invoice design trends from leading platforms (Stripe, FreshBooks, Square, Adobe), this document outlines the strategy to transform our invoice system into a visually stunning, best-in-class solution.

## Key Research Findings

### Modern Invoice Design Aesthetics
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Bold, high-contrast headings with tactile division lines

### Typography Best Practices
- **Font Hierarchy**: 18â€“24pt headings, 12â€“14pt body, 10â€“11pt secondary notes
- **Font Selection**: Sans-serif (Helvetica, Inter, Open Sans) for screen legibility
- **Typography Limits**: Maximum of two typefaces using weight/size for differentiation
- **Line Spacing**: 1.2â€“1.5 Ã— font size for optimal readability

### Leading Platform Patterns
- **Stripe**: Light/dark mode PDFs, customizable branding, sticky payment sidebar
